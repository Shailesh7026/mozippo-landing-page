            <p>Welcome to Mozippo! Your safety is our top priority. We want you to have a positive and secure experience while using
                Mozippo. Please read and follow these safety tips to help ensure your well-being while connecting with
                others on our platform.</p>

            <h2>1. Protect Your Personal Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Keep It Private:</span> Avoid sharing personal information such as your home
                    address, workplace, or financial details with people you just met.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Stay in the App:</span> Keep conversations within Mozippo’s messaging system
                    until you feel comfortable. Avoid moving to other platforms too quickly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Be Cautious with New Connections</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Take Your Time:</span> Don’t rush into meeting someone in person. Get to
                    know them through the app first.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Trust Your Instincts:</span> If something feels off, trust your gut. It’s
                    okay to end a conversation or block someone if you feel uncomfortable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Meeting in Person</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Choose Public Places:</span> For your first few dates, always meet in busy,
                    public locations.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Tell a Friend:</span> Let a friend or family member know your plans,
                    including where you’re going and who you’re meeting.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Stay Sober:</span> Avoid excessive alcohol or drugs that might impair your
                    judgment and make you vulnerable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Safety During the Date</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Control Your Transportation:</span> Use your own transportation to and from
                    the meeting location so you have the freedom to leave whenever you want.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Keep Your Phone Charged:</span> Make sure your phone is fully charged before
                    heading out. Consider sharing your location with a trusted friend during the date.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Emergency Plan:</span> Have a plan in place in case you feel unsafe. This
                    could include calling a friend or using a pre-arranged signal to get help.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Online Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Respect Boundaries:</span> Respect the other person’s boundaries and expect
                    them to respect yours. Consent is crucial.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Report Suspicious Activity:</span> If someone is behaving inappropriately or
                    violating our terms, report them through the app’s reporting feature. Your reports help us keep the
                    community safe.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Protect Your Account</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Secure Password:</span> Use a strong, unique password for your Mozippo
                    account and change it regularly.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Be Wary of Scams:</span> Be cautious of anyone asking for money or financial
                    assistance. Mozippo will never ask for your financial information through the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Know the Warning Signs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Red Flags:</span> Watch out for inconsistent or vague information, someone
                    refusing to meet in public, or pressuring you to share personal details.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Too Good to Be True:</span> Be skeptical of profiles that seem too perfect
                    or individuals who declare love or affection unusually quickly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Resources and Help</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Support:</span> If you encounter any issues or need assistance, our support

                    contact your local law enforcement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Continuous Awareness</h2>
            <ul>
